                     <h2 class="text-center text-dark">Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
                      <h6 class="text-center text-dark">By Eric Geier</h6>
                        <section3 class="Paragraph">
                          <blockquote>Cybersecurity is important because it protects all categories of data from theft and damage. 
  This includes sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), personal information, intellectual property, data, and governmental and industry information systems. 

  Without a cybersecurity program, your organization cannot defend itself against data breach campaigns, 
  making it an irresistible target for cybercriminals.</blockquote>
     <p>
      <h5>What is Cybersecurity?</h5>
      Cybersecurity is the state or process of protecting and recovering computer systems, networks, 
      devices, and programs from any type of cyber attack. Cyber attacks are an increasingly sophisticated 
      and evolving danger to your sensitive data, as attackers employ new methods powered by social 
      engineering and artificial intelligence to circumvent traditional security controls. 
      <br>
      The fact of the matter is the world is increasingly reliant on technology and this reliance will 
      continue as we introduce the next generation of smart Internet-enabled devices that have access to 
      our networks via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.<br><br>
      <h5>Importance of Cybersecurity</h5>
Cybersecurity's importance is on the rise. Fundamentally, our society is more technologically reliant 
than ever before and there is no sign that this trend will slow. Data leaks that could result in identity 
theft are now publicly posted on social media accounts. Sensitive information like social security numbers,
 credit card information and bank account details are now stored in cloud storage services like Dropbox or 
 Google Drive.<br><br>

The fact of the matter is whether you are an individual, small business or large multinational, you rely 
on computer systems every day. Pair this with the rise in cloud services, poor cloud service security,
 smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT) and we have a myriad of cybersecurity threats that didn't 
 exist a few decades ago. We need to understand the difference between cybersecurity and information 
 security, even though the skillsets are becoming more similar.<br><br>

Governments around the world are bringing more attention to cybercrimes. GDPR is a great example. It has 
increased the reputational damage of data breaches by forcing all organizations that operate in the EU to:
<br><br><ul>
<li>Communicate data breaches</li>
<li>Appoint a data-protection officer</li>
<li>Require user consent to process information</li>
<li>Anonymize data for privacy</li>
</ul>
The trend towards public disclosure is not limited to Europe. While there are no national laws 
overseeing data breach disclosure in the United States, there are data breach laws in all 50 states. 
Commonalities include: <br><br>

<ul>
<li>The requirement to notify those affect as soon as possible</li>
<li>Let the government know as soon as possible</li>
<li>Pay some sort of fine</li>
</ul>
California was the first state to regulate data breach disclosures in 2003, requiring persons or 
businesses to notify those affected "without reasonable delay" and "immediately following discovery". 
Victims can sue for up to $750 and companies can be fined up to $7,500 per victim.
<br>
This has driven standards boards like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to 
release frameworks to help organizations understand their security risks, improve cybersecurity 
measures and prevent cyber attacks.<br><br>

<h5>Why is Cybercrime Increasing?</h5>
Information theft is the most expensive and fastest growing segment of cybercrime. Largely driven by the 
increasing exposure of identity information to the web via cloud services. But it is not the only target.
 Industrial controls that manage power grids and other infrastructure can be disrupted or destroyed. And
  identity theft isn't the only goal, cyber attacks may aim to compromise data integrity (destroy or 
  change data) to breed distrust in an organization or government.
  <br><br>
Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated, changing what they target, how they affect organizations
 and their methods of attack for different security systems.
 <br><br>
Social engineering remains the easiest form of cyber attack with ransomware, phishing, and spyware being
 the easiest form of entry. Third-party and fourth-party vendors who process your data and have poor
  cybersecurity practices are another common attack vector, making vendor risk management and third-party
   risk management all the more important.
   <br><br>
According to the Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study from Accenture and the Ponemon Institute, 
the average cost of cybercrime for an organization has increased by $1.4 million over the last year to 
$13.0 million and the average number of data breaches rose by 11 percent to 145. Information risk 
management has never been more important.
<br><br>
Data breaches can involve financial information like credit card numbers or bank account details, 
protected health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), trade secrets, 
intellectual property and other targets of industrial espionage. Other terms for data breaches 
include unintentional information disclosure, data leak, cloud leak, information leakage or a data 
spill.
<br><br>
Other factors driving the growth in cybercrime include:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The distributed nature of the Internet</li>
<li>The ability for cybercriminals to attack targets outside their jurisdiction making policing extremely 
difficult</li>
<li>Increasing profitability and ease of commerce on the dark web</li>
<li>The proliferation of mobile devices and the Internet of Things.</li></ul><br>

<h5>What is the Impact of Cybercrime?</h5>
A lack of focus on cybersecurity can damage your business in range of ways including:
<br><br>
<h6>Economic costs</h6>
‍Theft of intellectual property, corporate information, disruption in trading and the cost of repairing 
damaged systems
<br><br>
<h6>Reputational cost</h6>
‍Loss of consumer trust, loss of current and future customers to competitors and poor media coverage
<br><br>
<h6>Regulatory costs</h6>
<strong>GDPR</strong>‍ and other data breach laws mean that your organization could suffer from regulatory
 fines or sanctions as a result of cybercrimes.
 <br><br>
All businesses, regardless of the size, must ensure all staff understand cybersecurity threats and how to
 mitigate them. This should include regular training and a framework to work with to that aims to reduce
  the risk of data leaks or data breaches. 
  <br><br>
Given the nature of cybercrime and how difficult it can be to detect, it is difficult to understand the
 direct and indirect costs of many security breaches. This doesn't mean the reputational damage of even
  a small data breach or other security event is not large. If anything, consumers expect increasingly
   sophisticated cybersecurity measures as time goes on.
   <br><br>
   <h5>How to Protect your Organization Against Cybercrime</h5>
There are three simple steps you can take you increase security and reduce risk of cybercrime:
<br><br>
<h6>Educate staff</h6>
Human error was the cause of 90% of data breaches in 2019. This concerning statistic, however, has a 
silver lining. If staff are taught how to identify and correctly resond to cyber threats, the majority 
of data breach incidents could be avoided. Such educational programs could also increase the value of 
all cybersecurity solution investments because it would prevent staff from unknowingly bypassing expensive 
security controls to facilitate cybercrime.
<br><br>
<h6>Protect your sensitive data</h6>
Invest in tools that limit information loss, monitor your third-party risk and fourth-party vendor risk 
and continuously scan for data exposure and leaked credentials. Data leaks, if left unattended, could help 
cybercriminals gain access internal networks and breach sensitive resources. It's important to implement 
a data leak discovery solution capable of also monitoring leaks throughout the third-party network.
<br><br>
Almost60% of data breaches occur via compromised third parties, so by shutting down vendor data leaks, 
the majority of data breach incidents can be avoided.
<br><br>
<h6>Implement a Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) solution</h6>
Use technology to reduce costs like automatically sending out vendor assessment questionnaires as part of
 an overall cyber security risk assessment strategy
 <br><br>
Companies should no longer be asking why is cybersecurity important, but how can I ensure my 
organization's cybersecurity practices are sufficient to comply with GDPR and other regulation and to 
protect my business against sophisticated cyber attacks.
